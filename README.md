# Tip-Calculator
The primary interface of this project features a labeled "Tip Calculator" box containing two spaces to input numbers: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator looks modern and is designed using CSS. I used JavaScript to get the numbers you input and figure out the total based on those numbers.
